[{"content":"A simpler way to manage your dotfiles Hello am edd I have been having trouble with configuration since i started using docker for my development.\nFor consistecy and time saving , i decided it would be great to manage my dotfiles using git and github and when creating new enviroments.\nI wrote the solution in this post, for easy reference if i need to in the future.\nWhat a dotfile Dotfile are file in the linux system that starts with a period. They are\nmainly used to store configuration files for the User instance for various\napplications. For me the dotfiles that i would love to manage are as\nfollow.\n .bashrc or .zshrc (dependent on the shell your using.) .vimrc .setup.sh  Yes setup.sh this is a custom setup script that i maintain to initially setup a new installation with all the setting and softwares i need in my\nsystem.Could be used to\n setup the configuration files managed by the git repository. Setup my keyboard mapping to the way a need them to be .  The keyboard mapping i love most, and spend alot of time setting it up\nis `Remapping caps lock to act as a control key when pressed together wi with other character, and behave as Escape when pressed alone.\nI would love to automate the process , so that i dont even think about it.\nLike most folks, I use git to manage my dotfiles. This lets me have a\nversioned backup for my configurations, and if something breaks (and it\noften does) I can revert to a working configuration fairly easily. I came across a post of how to manage the dotfiles without the need for any\nsymlinking.\nThe key idea is really simple: make $HOME the git work-tree. The normal way of doing this would be to do a git init in you $HOME, but that\nwould totally mess up git commands if you have other repositories in your\n$HOME (also, you probably don\u0026rsquo;t want your entire $HOME in a git repository.\nWe will create a dummy folder and initialize a bare repository.Essentially\na git repo with no working directory) in there. All git commands will be run with our dummy as the git directory, but $HOME as the work directory.\nFirst Time Setup Setting this method up the first time is really easy. First, let\u0026rsquo;s create\nour bare repository. I chose to name my placeholder .dotfiles\n1 2  mkdir $HOME/.dotfiles git init --bare $HOME/.dotfiles   Now for fun part. We will make an alias for running git commands in our\n.dotfiles repository. I\u0026rsquo;m calling my alias dotfiles: .Make sure you reference the right dotfiles\nfolder in you home folder.\n1  alias dotfiles=\u0026#39;/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME\u0026#39;   Add this alias to your .bashrc. From now any git operation you would like to do in the .dotfiles repository can be done by the dotfiles alias. The\ncool thing is that you can run dotfiles from anywhere.\nLets add a remote and also set status now to show untracked files.\n1 2  dotfiles config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no dotfiles remote add origin https://github.com/eduuh/dotfiles.git   Setting Up a New Machine To set up a new machine to use your version controlled config files, all\nyou need to do is to clone the repository on your new machine telling git that it is a bare repository:\n1  git clone --separate-git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles https://github.com/eduuh/dotfiles.git   However, some programs create default config files, so this might fail if git finds an existing config file in your $HOME. In that case a simple sol is to clone to a temporayry directory and then delete it once you are done:\n1  git clone --separate-git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles https://github.com/eduuh/dotfiles.git   So this might fail if git finds an existing config file in your $HOME. In that case, a simple solution is to clone to a temporary directory , and then delete it once you are done:\n1 2 3 4  $ git clone --separate-git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles https://github.com/eduuh/dotfiles.git --recursive --verbose --exclude \u0026#39;.git\u0026#39; tmpdotfiles/ $HOME/ $ rm -r tmpdotfiles   The last step is to add the dotfile alias in your bashrc or zshrc according to the shell you are\nusing.\n1  $ alias dotfiles=\u0026#39;/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME\u0026#39;c   Using the dotfiles alias For the Dotfiles repository, Your will use dotfiles instead of git. Use it as you normally use git\ncommands.\nExample of some Commands:\nA commit command.\n1 2 3 4 5  $ dotfiles commit -m \u0026#34;zshrc =\u0026gt; zsh oh my god configuration files \u0026#34; [master 64a553b] zshrc =\u0026gt; zsh oh my god configuration files 1 file changed, 91 insertions(+) create mode 100644 .zshrc   A push action.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  $ dotfiles push Enumerating objects: 4, done. Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done. Delta compression using up to 4 threads Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done. Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 1.45 KiB | 1.45 MiB/s, done. Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0) To https://github.com/eduuh/dotfiles.git 7d507e7..64a553b master -\u0026gt; master   The repository will be downloaded but there might exist some configuration files in your home\ndirectory to make sure you are using the right configuration file use git checkout to actually copy\nthe copy in your repository to the working directory.\n1  dotfiles checkout $HOME/.bashrc   Or easy is to checkout to the latest commit. Remember Head points to the latest commit use that.\n1 2  dotfiles reset --hard HEAD HEAD is now at 64a553b zshrc =\u0026gt; zsh oh my god configuration files   64a553b at this time this is my latest commit.\nDo not worry git reset --hard copied files available in your repository to both the staging area and the working area . It should not mess with your untracted files which i believe they are\nmany, since this is a repository monitoring the $HOME directory.\nThere you go. No symlink mess.\nMy dotfiles are here for reference.\n","description":"Efficient way to manage configuration files in a linux system.","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":["productivity",""],"title":"Managing Dotfiles Like a Pro","uri":"https://eduuh.github.io/posts/mngdotfilelikeapro/"},{"content":"Javascript deep dive tutorial This note are inspired by KYLE SIMPSON javascrip book series. I like how the ideas in the book are shared.\nI have being doing c# for the backend and to complete my journey for becoming a full stack developer.\nI needed to do alot of javascript, so immediately i started using typescript for my web development and i would say the experience with typescript is supper great. I was reading up on \u0026lsquo;react\u0026rsquo; and realized the documentation is not in typescript, and decided to do some research and answer the question\nwhen should i use typescript? read the Alex blog about the topic.\nI wount go into the detail of when i should use typescript. That could be a subject for another post. Being a student i have alot time to learn\nso i decide to at least spend some time learning javascript in a deep way to try and understand commonly misunderstood concepts. Hope you code along me when performing this examples.\nUp and Going In this deep dive you will learn about:\n Webstandards Sematic markup Well commented code  The code isn\u0026rsquo;t just your Job anymore, its your craft\nwe will be intrested with javascript syntax and understanding the terminology. You already know javascript to be the foundation of interactive expriences on the web. I have come to understand that javascript is one of the easiest language to get started with, i had let the typescript advertisement get to me. I dont say typescript is not awesome , but it is transpiled to javascript eventually.\nThe trouble with javascript is that is can be used without understanding how the internal works, the understanding of language is never attained.\nWe get Answers of How and why The language behave the way it does but before that let me promote the language first\n Javascript is awesome. Javascript is easy to learn and much harder to learn completely  When we developers encounters confusion we usually tend to blame the language instead of their lack of understanding.\nwhen i say javascript what to i mean? Yes! a programming language with a specific syntax used to write the source code.\n Syntax -\u0026gt; the rule for valid format and combination of instructions. Source code -\u0026gt; A set of instructions to tell the computer what task to perform.  Statements A group of words , numbers and operators that performs a specific task . Example\n1 2  a = b * 3;    3 -\u0026gt; literal value a \u0026amp; b are variables (sybolic placeholders for the values themselves.  Most Javascript statements ends with a semicolon ; at the end.\nPrograms are usually just a collection of many such statements which together describe all the steps.\nExpressions An expression is any reference to a variable or value , or a set of variables and values combined with operators.\nlet take the above example\n1  a = b *3;   The above statement contains four expressions in it.\n 2 -\u0026gt; literal value b -. variable expression (used to retrieve its current value b * 3 -\u0026gt; arithmetic expression which in this case its (multiplication) a = b * 3 -\u0026gt; assignment oxpressions (assings the result of b * 3 to a )  Executing a Program Executiong is also refered to as running the program.\nstatement like a = b * 3  are good for developers to read and write code but not very uselful to the computer. A special utility on the computer can\neither be an interpreter or a compiler is used to translate the code you write into command that computer can understand..\nTranslation is done ahead of time is called compiling code so whe the program run later what is runnind is actually the compiled source code.\nJavascript is interpreted because your Js code is processed each time it\u0026rsquo;s runs. This is not completely accurate since the JS engine actually compiles\nprogramm on the fly and then immediately runs the compied code.\nOutput 1 2 3  console.log( a ); // using the dom api  alert( a );   Input Receivind information from the users most common is to use html elememt like a text boxes to the user that she can type into and then JS to read those\nvalues.\n1 2 3  age = prompt ( \u0026#39;please tell me your age\u0026#39; );   Operators    Operators Examples of Operators     1. Mathematical operators + , - , / , *   2. Assignement operators a = 3   3. Compound assignment += , -= , and /= ie a +=2   4. Increment /decrement ++ (increment ) , \u0026ndash;(decrement ) a++   5. Equality operators ==(loose equals) , ==== (strict equals) != (loose not equals) , !== (strict not equal)   6. Comparison operators \u0026lt; (less than ) , \u0026gt; (greater than) , \u0026lt;=(less than or loose equals )   7. Logical operators \u0026amp; (and) ,    Values and Types    Type values examples     numbers 45, 4, 35, 33, 555.45,   strings \u0026ldquo;Edwin\u0026rdquo; , \u0026lsquo;Muraya\u0026rsquo;   boolean true , false    Combination of the Types and Values form arrays and Objects.\nCoersion Between types. This can be done explictly or implicit.\nCode comments The choices you make about how to write program that works correctly but programs that make sense when examined.\nCode comments are bits of text in your program that inserted purely explains things to a human being reading your code.\nThe interpreter/ compiler will ingnore these comments.\nA general guideline to writing comments in the code.\n code without comments is suboptimal Too many comments is probably a sign of poorly written code. Comment should explain why not what .  types of comments\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7  // single line comments  /* multi line comments */   Variables (containers) Holds a specific type of a value. JS uses dynamic typing meaning variables can holds value of any type without any type enforment.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7  var amount = 99.99; amount = amount * 3; console.log( amount ); amount = \u0026#34;$\u0026#34; + String( amount ); console.log( amount );   Amount holds a running value that changes ove the course of the program. Primary purpose of the variables is to manage the state of the\napplication. (program state management).\nconst\t-\u0026gt; useful just like variables with unchanged values except that constant also prevent accidentally changing value initially set.\nBlock A group or a series of statement together which we often call a block. {}\n1 2 3 4  { amount = amount * 2; console.log( amount ); }   Blocks are usualyy attached to some other control statements such as an if statement.\n1 2 3 4 5 6  var amount = 99.99; if( amount \u0026gt; 10 ){ amount = amount * 2; console.log( amount ); }   Conditionals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  var bank_balance = 302.12; var amount = 99.99; if( amount \u0026lt; bank_balance){ console.log(\u0026#39; I want to bu this \u0026#34;); } else { console.log( \u0026#39;No thanks\u0026#39; ); }   Other conditionals include the Switch statement.\nLoops Repeats a set of conditions until a certain condition fails, repeats only when condition holds.\nA loop includes a condition check as wells as a bloc of statements and each time a loop block executs , it called a interation .\nexample\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  // while loop code  while( numofCustomer \u0026gt; 0) { console.log(\u0026#39;how may i help you?\u0026#39;); numofCustomer -=1; } // do loop code  do{ console.log( \u0026#39;how may i help you\u0026#39;); numberofCustomer = numberofCustomer - 1; } while(numberofCustomer \u0026gt; 0);   If condition is false , a while loop will not run but a do while loop will run just for the first time.\nThe condition is tested on each iteration and you could use break statement to stop a loop.\nExample of another loop is the For loop.\n1 2 3  for( var i = 0; i \u0026lt; 9; i=i+1) { console.log( i ); }   the loop contains the following.\n initialization clause var i = 0 conditional test clause i\u0026lt;9 update clause i=i + 1O  Transpiling There\u0026rsquo;s no way to polyfill new syntax that been added to the language. The new syntax would throw an error in the old JS engine os recognisezed/invalid.\nThe better option is to use a tool that convert your newer code into older equivalents.A process called \u0026ldquo;transpiling\u0026rdquo; a term for transforming + compiling.\nYour source code is authored in the new syntax form, but what is deploy to the browser is the transpiled code in old syntax form.\nThe transpiler is inserted to your buil process, similar to your code linter or your minifier. Then why would you write new syntax only to have it\ntranspiled away to older code- why not just write the older code directly?\n some reasons for this are\n  The new syntax added to language is designed to make your code more readable and maintainable. You would prefer writing new syntax not only for\nyourselve but also for your development team. If you transpile only for older browsers, but serve the new syntax to the newest browsers, you get to take advantage of browser perfomance optimization\nwith the new syntax. This also lets browser makes have more real-world code to test their implementations and optimizations on. New syntax allows it to be tested more robustly in the real world , which provides earlier feedback to the Javascript committee.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  // ES6 code function foo( a = 2 ){ console.log( a ); } foo( ); // prints 2 foo(5); //prints 5  // transpiled to the code below function foo() { var a = arguments[0] !==(void 0) ? arguments[0] : 2; console.log( a ); }   As you see it checks to see if the arguments[0] value is void 0 (aka undefined) and if so provides the 2 default value; otherwise, it assigns whatever was\npassed. Transpilers should now be thought of as a standar part of the JS developmend ecosystem and process. JS is going to continue to evolve, much more\nquickly than before, so every few months new syntax and new features will be added.\n Examples of transpilers for you to choose from. Here are good ones to try.\n  BABEl\n- Transpiles ES6+ into ES5 Traceur\n- Transpiles ES6 , ES7 and beyound into ES5  Non-JavaScript The reality of this language is written to run in and interact with environments like browsers. A good chunk of the stuff that you write in your code is,\nstrictly speaking, not directly controlled by Javascript. That probably sounds a little strange. A good example is the Dom Api for example.\n1 2  var el = document.getElementByID(\u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;);   The document varible exist as a global variable when your code is running in the browser. It\u0026rsquo;s not provided by the Js engine, nor is\nit particulary controlled by the Javascript specification. It takes the form of something that looks an awful lot like a normal JS object, but it\u0026rsquo;s not really exactly that. It\u0026rsquo;s a special object, often called a host object.\nThe getElementByID(..) method on document looks like a normal JS function, but it\u0026rsquo;s just a thinly exposed interface to built-in method provided by the DOM\nfrom your browser. In newer browser the layer my be in JS but in older browser the layer is in c/c++.\nAnother example could be the input/output (I/O).\nThe alert() pops us a message box in the user\u0026rsquo;s browser window. alert() is provided to your JS program by the browser, not by the JS engine itself.\nThe call you make sends the message to the browser internals and it handles drawind and displayind the message box.\nThe same goes to console.log() your browser provides such mechanisms and hooks them up to the developers tools.\nReview The first step to learning Js flavor of programming is to get a basic understanding ot its core mechanisms like :\n values types function closure this prototypes.  Serious developers in other languages expect to put the effort to learn most of all of the language(s) they primarily write in, but JS developers\nseem to stant out from the crowd in the sence of typically not learning very much of the language. This is not a good thing, and it\u0026rsquo;s not something\nwe should continue to allow to be the norm.\nAt this moment, am going to ask you guys.\nAre you up for the challenge, or do you want to learn the most minimum of js to get you started in code?\nHere is my answer, i would love to invest my time know to learn the internal of js and be able to answer the why question in code.\nSo let go into it.\nwe are going to go in this order and what we will cover in each step.\n  Scope and Closures\n how scoping of variables really works in javascript. common misconceptions that js is an \u0026lsquo;interpreted language\u0026rsquo; and therefore not compiled. Deeper understanding of the compiler approach, how to find and deal with variables and functions declarations. Scope management (hoisting) lexical scope and closure as the main important concept of js    this and Object prototypes.\n Understant the this keyword and common mistakes. Prototype behaviour pattern, behaviour delegation    type \u0026amp; Grammar\n Type coersion. implicit coercion and explicit coersion. What part of coeasion make complete sense if given the time to learn. do you want to keep following what the crowds say or are you willing to\nset all the assumptions aside and look at coersion with a fresh perspective.    Async \u0026amp; Performance\n Asynchrony programming in not only critical to the performance of our applications , it\u0026rsquo;s increasingly becoming the critical factor in writabiliy\nand maintainability. callbacks inversion of control. promises and generators.

Before jumping to react you will need to have the basics of the following:\n what is HTML What is CSS What is Dom what is ES6 What is Node.js What is npm  If you cant answer the question ,jump to freecode camp org to get started.\nHow does React Work  React creates a virtual dom in memory.  Instead of manipulation the browsers Dom directly, React create a virtual dom in memory,where it does all the necessary manipulatiog,before making the changes in the browser Dom.   React change only what needs to be changed   React finds out what changets have been made, and changes only what needs to be changet.  Create React App In order to learn and test react you will need to have React Environment installed in your local computer.\nYou will need to install node.js ,npm and create-react-app.\nNode.js Node.js is a javascript runtime built on chrome's V8 Javascript engine.

After you finish the exercises we are\nthen going to it together, to make sure you understand.\nRequirements  Command Line that support unix style commands git version \u0026gt; 2.0 (check with git \u0026ndash;version) github.com account This Repository 👇  1  git clone git@github.com:eduuh/Advanced-GitWorkshop.git   Are we all good at these requirements. Okay Let get into it.\nI know when we learn git we memorize 6 command the rest of git is usually a black box that we don\u0026rsquo;t explore. We reach at a point where we really on the GUI tool available for working with git. I.e visual studio code.Today we are going to go a lot deeper to git away from this basic commands and explore git further.\nMy \u0026ldquo;assumption\u0026rdquo; is you are familiar with this commands. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if you are a beginner you will get into pace soon.\n   Command Action     git clone clone a remote repository : github, gitlab , azure repos   git push Push local repository to remote service   git fetch Pull changes to a local repository   git pull -f git fetch + git merge (used flags right)   git init Initialize a repository locally   git add \u0026amp; git commit Add changes to a local repository.    If you are not famialiar with the above commands. Please bare with me, this are usually common concept that we can\u0026rsquo;t do without them. When we come across them i will explain to you what they do.\nI felt this way untill i decided its time to level up a little bit and come out of my confort zone. Using GUI tools. In my case visual studio code.\nDo you feel this way?\nIts a sad place to be. Are you exited to not do this anymore!?\nI will try to get you out of this showing you how to use git the right way.\nBefore you delete you could decide to look up some manual page for git online and this is what you might get.\nWAT?\nThe SYNOPSIS WTH does it mean??\n git refers to its self as A stupid content tracker funny\nBut this depends on how your use case and mood.\n  Notes  People use git for different use cases. You should try to use the idea from this workshop and incoporate them to your workflows.\nI have divided this workshop into sections , and after each sections. Am going to give an exercise which you will attempt. And then we are going to them together.\nLets focus more on doing and understanding the theory. This is what i mean. Instead of writing down the notes focus on trying out the commands. You have all these notes with you.\nGit is a tool to helps you,but not work against you.\nGit concepts  Untracked Files  New files that git have not requested to track previously.\n Working Area  Worked that is tracked by git that has been modified but have not yet been commited.\n Staging Area  Modified files that have been marked to go the next commit.\nThis are terms that will appear mostly in this workshop.\nHow is information stored. At its core, git is like a key value store.\n Value = Data (our files) Key =\u0026gt; Sha1 Key   Key  Its a crytographic hash function. Given a piece of data , it produces a 40 - digit hexadecimal numbers. You will see this in a bit.\nThis value should always be the same if the given Input it the same.\n Value  Git store the compressed data in a blob , along with the metadata in a header. Holds the identifier of the, size of the content and the content itself.\nNote: The content is compressed and when you cat into it you will get a whole lot of nothings.\nUnder the Hood - Lets create a git hash object. Git will take our content and use it to generate the hash key. For now we could supply some content to git using echo command.\nIf you run the command. Here we are piping the output of the echo command to the git hash function requesting to use the stdin\nThe hash function returns the a hash which should be the same for all of us.your can try this\n1 2  echo hello | git hash-object --stdin # ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a   We already know some tools that are used to generate sha1 keys. For my system I believe its openssl\nlets generate Sha1 using openssl\n1 2  echo hello | openssl sha1 # (stdin)= f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f   Thes hash are different. This is because git hash function **prepends thes string \u0026ldquo;blob\u0026rdquo; followed by the file size and a null to the file\u0026rsquo;s content before hashing.\nThis is how git calculates the sha1 for the file (in git term a blob)\nGit calculate the files metadata + content , not just the content.\n1  # sha1(\u0026#34;blob\u0026#34; + filesize + \u0026#34;\\0\u0026#34; + data) # not \\0 is a null byte   When you run the hash function on the same content you will always get the same result.\n Lets initialize a repository  1 2  git init # Initialized empty Git repository in $HOME/username/dir/.git/   The initialized repository is store at .git directory.\nWhey you delete this folder in a repository you actually blow up the repository, but you retains the files that were availble in the working area.\n question: where are blob stored?  We are going to rerun the command that ask git to generate a sha1 key for the content but this time we pass a option , -w that indicates we want to write the object to the git repo.\n1 2  echo hello | git hash-object -w --stdin ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a   Take a note at the hash generated at this point. and lets access how it is saved in the git folder.\n lets do some clean up first\n Remove the hooks directory in the repository, so that it does not get into our way.\n1  rm -rf .git/hooks # r =\u0026gt; recusive f =\u0026gt; folders   Now you can tree into the .git folder to pic at all the content.\nNote if you have alot of files in your working directory u are going to have a longer structure. ***The output look something like.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23  tree .git/ .git/ ├── branches ├── config ├── description ├── HEAD ├── index ├── info │ └── exclude ├── logs │ ├── HEAD │ └── refs │ ├── heads │ │ └── master │ └── remotes │ └── origin │ └── HEAD ├── objects │ ├── 07 │ │ └── 9830d5ae8de34a3faf6bd8ff8b680684948bec │ ├── ce │ │ └── 013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a   Our initial sha1 file was ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a.\nwhat do you notice?  Our blob is stored in the object folder. You can\u0026rsquo;t see that yet but you will.  2 Inside a subfolder which picks the first two char of the blob (ce)\n3.The blob object as the rest of the char (013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a)\nDo this Step by step  Create an empty directory and initialize a new repository  Copy the command as it will work.\n mkdir makes a directory. cd move into the directory git init initiaze the repository  1  mkdir test ; cd test ; git init   One you initialize a repository a .git folder is created where all git information is stored.\nThe .git folder have a few empty directories. If you have never checked the .git directory lets start now.\nCheck the folder structure of the .git directory.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  ls -la .git drwxr-xr-x 7 edd eduuh 4096 Feb 15 19:45 ./ drwxr-xr-x 3 edd eduuh 4096 Feb 15 19:45 ../ drwxr-xr-x 2 edd eduuh 4096 Feb 15 19:45 branches/ -rw-r--r-- 1 edd eduuh 92 Feb 15 19:45 config -rw-r--r-- 1 edd eduuh 73 Feb 15 19:45 description -rw-r--r-- 1 edd eduuh 23 Feb 15 19:45 HEAD drwxr-xr-x 2 edd eduuh 4096 Feb 15 19:45 hooks/ drwxr-xr-x 2 edd eduuh 4096 Feb 15 19:45 info/ drwxr-xr-x 4 edd eduuh 4096 Feb 15 19:45 objects/ drwxr-xr-x 4 edd eduuh 4096 Feb 15 19:45 refs/   Remove the .git/hooks folder. you dont need for now  1  rm -rf `.git/hooks`   Look at the folder structure in a graphical way using the tree command.  1  tree .git/   Lets add a file in our repository. Using the echo command you can redirect the output to a file.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  # will write the line ot gitstuff.txt file echo \u0026#39;an awesome guide to git\u0026#39; \u0026gt; gitstuff.txt # you can check the content of the file using cat command cat gitstuff.txt git hash-object -w gitstuff.txt # 24997081c3c51eeac9df4309dbcc9452112a8f1f   You should have the same hash code as i get here as long us you use the same content as i did.\nThis time the git hash function command takes a path to a file unlike intially where echo was used to input to the stdin of the function\nSomething i realize with the **ls -la** command that actually the blob is a file. We can just read from it since it compressed into a **c binary** file. Lets try fo fun  lets us the find command to look for all files. Since we now know the blob are store in the object we could narrow our search in directory.\n1 2  find .git/object/ --type f # .git/objects/24/997081c3c51eeac9df4309dbcc9452112a8f1f   We\u0026rsquo;ve created our first object! this is a binary file that holds what we just saved.\nNote The object id is choosen based on the content of the object. This is how git stores our object. Let me use the right word here content-addressable filesystem.\nLets try to save the same file again.  1  git hash-object -w gitstuff.txt   Because it the same content, nothing changes we will receive the same sha1 hash key\nQuestion: How can we see the content of the blob??  When you cat pathtofile you will get a whole lot of nothing.To be more accurate a binary output\nLets try\n1 2 3 4 5 6  # use the find command to get the path find .git/objects -type f # .git/objects/24/997081c3c51eeac9df4309dbcc9452112a8f1f cat .git/objects/24/997081c3c51eeac9df4309dbcc9452112a8f1f # xK��OR02aH�SH,O-��MUH/�LIU(�WH�,���   Git provides a functions to view the content of blobs.cat-file\n -p =\u0026gt; print out pretty print -t =\u0026gt; print out the type  For this command you use the sha1 hash as the arguement.\n1 2 3 4 5  git cat-file -p 24997081 # an awesome guide to git git cat-file -t 24997081 # blob   Useful commands    command detail     mkdir  creates a directory   git init initialize git in the directory   ls -la .git lists the content of the .git directory   find .git/object/ -type -f list all files available in a directory   git hash-object -w  Saves the files to a git object store.   git cat-file -p  pretty print the content of the object in the git object store.    Exercise 1 These are some exercise to get used to the idea of storing to and\nretrieving files from git objects store.\n   create a new directory, and initialize it.\n    look inside the .git folder. make sure you indetify folders and files\n    use a text editor or the command line to create multiple files and write some text to it.\n    use git hash function to generate the sha1 hash and save the object to the git object store.\n    Use git command to inspect the object in the database.\n   Under the Hood of a commit For a commit to be complete we need to store the information about thefile\nThe basic way git store information is using blob and trees .\nOur blob does not store all the information.\n filenames. directory structure.  Question: wheres is this information stored in git? Trees A git tree object creates a hierachy between files in the git repository and the directory structures.\nEvery commit holds a single tree . A tree holds the following informantion.\nTree points to other.\n blob Also point to other trees.  Metadata of the tree\n type of pointer filename of directory name mode (excutable file, symbolic link,..)  Lets do it step by step Let\u0026rsquo;s start with a new sample repository again,but this time we doing things manually, so we get the feeling of what is happening under the hood.\nFor the repository we created a while back lets delete the .git folder . and initilize a new repository.\n1 2 3 4 5  rm -rf .git # create a file again echo \u0026#39;Hello , Edwin\u0026#39; \u0026gt; greeting.txt git init git add greating.txt   Lets say it all start when we add the file to the index / staging area. When I added the file to , a change occured in my repository this can\u0026rsquo;t be view as a commit yet but there is a command to see what happened.\n1 2  git ls-files --stage # 100644 9f704ffe0495c8f1416cc004f5638e06e78bf14e 0 greeting.txt   We have not commited anything yet but we already have an object in our repo. Let get the hash id of\nour content in the file we already know how to do that.\n1 2  git hash-object greeting.txt # 9f704ffe0495c8f1416cc004f5638e06e78bf14e   You realizes the the hash key is the same as that of the content of the greeting.txt\nYou could also use the cat-file -t on the hash to see the type of the object it represent. At this case you will find that its a blob.\nthe same file will always result with the same blob. 1 2  git cat-file -t 9f704ffe0495c # blob   At this point , The blob is not reference by any tree and there are no commits yet. At this point the object is anly referenced from a file named .git/index which reference the blob and the tree that makes up the current index.\nLets make a tree 1 2  $ git write-tree # 438fa6e39f5e86e72bd959b0c12019f1e39cc70d   A tree containing the same blob or sub-blobs will always have the same hash id. We dont have a commit but we have a tree now.\n Lets make a commit manually by using the tree directly\n 1 2  echo \u0026#39;Initial commit\u0026#39; | git commit-tree 438fa6e39f5e # 672df89e038ea79fdac61e8686afe65d07b49dbb   the raw commit function takes the tree\u0026rsquo;s hash id and makes a commit object to hold it. If i wanted the commit to have a parent i could specify the parent commit with -p .\nNote my commit hash id and your will be different since it uses my name and the current date as the content to generate the commit object.\nlet see a commit object. A commit is a code snapshot.\nA commit points to\n A tree A parent commit  and contains metadata: The content used to generate the Sha1 files.\n author and committer\ndate\nmessage\nparend commit (one or more)\n Identical content is only store once.\nOptimization - Packfiles and Deltas   Git object are compressed .\n  As files change, their content remains mostly similar.\n you might add a method here or there.    Git optimize for this by compressing these files together, into a Packfiles.\n  The packfile stores the object and deltas , of the differences between one version of the file and the next.\n  Packfiles are generated when:\nYou have too many objects , during garabage collection, or during a push to remote.\n  Git perform a garbage collection once in a few weeks or when you explicity request it to.\nYou kind of start to understand what happens during a git push where you see that message.\n compressing deltas\nThe sha1 of the commit is the hash of all this information.\n Practically  lets perfom a git status on the repo we created.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24  git status On branch master No commits yet Untracked files: (use \u0026#34;git add \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;...\u0026#34; to include in what will be committed) learn-copy.txt learn.txt git add . # add all the files to the staging area git commit -m \u0026#34;finished working on gitworkshop\u0026#34; [master (root-commit) 3cb087a] finished working on git workshop 2 files changed, 4 insertions(+) create mode 100644 learn-copy.txt create mode 100644 learn.txt tree .git/objects .git/objects/ ├── 1e │ └── 234f233918794921501400511445247278c890 ├── 3c │ └── b087a3be11296eee71a0527dfe77a139688d68   Note after a commit, git provide the first character of the sha1 hash identifier for the commit. for this case its 3cb087a .\nA commit object is also store similary to the blobs.\nWhen you look into the .git/objects directory using the tree\ncommand. you notice that the commit create a folder structure and has an object in it.\nGit-file -T (Type) and -P (PRINT) THE CONTENT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  $ git cat-file -t 3cb087a commit $ git cat-file -p 3cb087a tree 1e234f233918794921501400511445247278c890 author eduuh \u0026lt;edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com\u0026gt; 1581803358 +0300 committer eduuh \u0026lt;edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com\u0026gt; 1581803358 +0300 finished working on git workshop   What we Learn from this  We can\u0026rsquo;t change the Commits! You cannot rewrite history.\nwe can\u0026rsquo;t go back and change the author or any other data.\n   If you change any data about the commit, the commit will have a new SHA1 hash.\n  Even if the files don\u0026rsquo;t change the date will and this result to a new hash\n  This give use the sense of high security in git and you will always know that your commit history will always maintaint its integrity. No one in your team can mess with your commit message without becoming obvious.\n  It also secures agaish corruption. If files on the disk change, the repository will notify that the content do not match.\n  REFERENCES POINTERS TO COMMITS . Are stored in .git/refs directory\nExamples of References.\n tags =\u0026gt; Points to a speciefic commit. They don\u0026rsquo;t change : used to version you code. branch =\u0026gt; Points to the latest commit.

This is because, there in no pulling in other data. but its just changing the pointers.\nReview: Places where code lives  Working area Staging area Repository  Working area The files in your working area that are also not in the staging area are not handled by git.\nAlso called untracked files\nThe staging area  What files are going to be part of your next commit. the staging area is how git knows what will change between the current commit and the next commit.  Tip: a clean staging area isn\u0026rsquo;t empty! consider the baseline staging area as being an exact copy of the latest commit. The Repository The files git knows about ! Contans all of your commit.\nthe repository is stored in the .git folder.\nMoving files in \u0026amp; of the staging area    command Action     git add  Add a file to the next commit.   git rm  delete a file in the next commit   git mv  rename a file in the next commit:    Git ADD -p  One of my favorite tools  allows you to stage commits in hunks Interactively\nIt\u0026rsquo;s especially useful if you\u0026rsquo;ve done too much work for one commit.\nUnstage files fron the staging area Not removing the files\nYou\u0026rsquo;re replacing them with a copy that\u0026rsquo;s currently in the repository.\nGit STASH This is usually a way to save uncommited work. The stash is safe from destructive operations.\nchanging between branches which requires you to have commited all your changes.  Git stash Basic use    Command Action     git stash stash changes   git stash list list stashed changes   git stash show stash{0} show content of the stash   git stash apply apply the last stash to the working directory   git stash pop applys the last stash and deletes it   git stash drop stash{0} deletes a specified stash from memory    By default git stash stash tracked files that are either in the repository or staging area.\nAdvanced STASHING - Operations Let give a scenario. You have added a new file in the repository and you dont want to git add it yet, but you need\nto switch to a different branch. Advanced stashing comes in\nhandy. If you switch to a different branch with untracted files\nin your working area you could accidentally commit this file.\nKeeping untracted file it a stash    Command Action     git stash \u0026ndash;include-untracked Stash even the untracked files (very uselful)   git stash -all Use this with caution. Stashes even ingnored files   git stash save \u0026ldquo;WIP: making progress on foo\u0026rdquo; Names stashes for easy reference   git stash branch  Make a new branch from a stash   git checkout \u0026ndash;filename Grab a single files from a stash   git stash pop applies the last stash. Does not apply if there is a conflict   git stash drop stash@{0} Remove the specified stash   git stash clear Removes all the stash    Follow along Exercise : Git Concepts Prerequisite You should have the advanced-git-exercises repository cloned locally. Checkout the git2 branch to begin:\n$\u0026gt; git checkout git3 Switched to branch 'git2'  Create a new folder and initialize it as a git repo Create a file, stage it, and commit it to your new repo Look at your .git folder, using tree if you have it Inspect the objects in your .git/objects folder using git cat-file. See if you can find the tree, blob, and commit objects for your recent commit. Look at your .git/HEAD and .git/refs/heads/master files and see if you can figure out where these references are pointing to.  Solutions Step 1 - Initialize the Repo Create a new sample project folder. Run git status to see that it is not yet a git repository. Use git init to initialize it as a repository.\n$\u0026gt; mkdir -p ~/projects/sample $\u0026gt; cd ~/projects/sample $\u0026gt; git status fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git $\u0026gt; git init # if not using my repo Initialized empty Git repository in /eduuh/projects/sample/.git/ Step 2 - First Commit Create a new document, stage it for a commit, then commit it to your repository.\n$\u0026gt; echo 'Hello World!' \u0026gt; hello.txt $\u0026gt; git add hello.txt $\u0026gt; git commit -m \u0026quot;Initial commit\u0026quot; [master (root-commit) aceb9e8] Initial commit 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) create mode 100644 hello.txt Step 3 - View the .git Folder Using tree, look in your .git/objects folder, you should now see three objects, represented by long SHA1 hashes. These represent the tree, blob, and commit that we created in the last step.\n$\u0026gt; tree .git .git ├── COMMIT_EDITMSG ├── HEAD ├── config ├── description ├── index ├── info │ └── exclude ├── logs │ ├── HEAD │ └── refs │ └── heads │ └── master ├── objects │ ├── 43 │ │ └── 388fee19744e8893467331d7853a6475a227b8 │ ├── 58 │ │ └── 1caa0fe56cf01dc028cc0b089d364993e046b6 │ ├── 98 │ │ └── 0a0d5f19a64b4b30a87d4206aade58726b60e3 │ ├── info │ └── pack └── refs ├── heads │ └── master └── tags Step 4 - Inspect the Objects: Note: The SHA1 hash for your commit will be different than the one displayed here. The SHA1 hash for your blob and tree will be the same as mine, as long as the content is the same.\nOne of the objects should be a tree object. The tree contains the filename hello.txt and a pointer to the blob.\nIf you are working on a big repository it might be obvious what your object is but you could use the commit to get to the tree.\nUsing the git cat-file\nuse git log to get the latest commit sha1 key hash.\nThe commit object contains a pointer to the tree, along with metadata for the commit, such as the author and commit message.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  git log | head -n 1 # git --no-pager log --oneline #d49019 git cat-file -t d49019 # commit git cat-file -p d49019 tree f21db101b5860d09c98d808ae21aaa96fa512414 parent dd160f7cbcaef119f7fb3063df6e9d0607b5e89c author eduuh \u0026lt;edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com\u0026gt; 1582476695 +0300 committer eduuh \u0026lt;edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com\u0026gt; 1582476695 +0300   # inspect the tree $\u0026gt; git cat-file -t f21db101b5860 tree $\u0026gt; git cat-file -p f21db101b5860 100644 blob 88a21c6d5ef21e36b68142ccee7aaa6e8344acc2 LICENSE 100644 blob 672c2366c2e9e734bb808b1acccc3722c3265800 README.md 040000 tree 04b14ff559132da3a2223e7ff70fee0ad330b43e exercises 040000 tree 3dbfb8a9affa3a8eef5aee2b516a15716b940fda gitimages 100644 blob 18c5b29d788326339b39df657ad2c9134de2ac45 gitlogo.png 100644 blob 24997081c3c51eeac9df4309dbcc9452112a8f1f gitstuff.txt 100644 blob 9f704ffe0495c8f1416cc004f5638e06e78bf14e greeting.txt 100644 blob 980a0d5f19a64b4b30a87d4206aade58726b60e3 hello.txt 040000 tree d77e62d1e686822d0c406d06b559c0694d24d8d9 notes 040000 tree cb9d9e857b50525267342b20a040c4911bc61416 scripts The blob object, pointed to by the tree, contains the contents of the file hello.txt\n$\u0026gt; git cat-file -t 980a0d5 blob $\u0026gt; git cat-file -p 980a0d5 Hello World! Note: our very first commit, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a parent. The next commit we make will point to our initial commit as the parent. Step 5 - Look at refs Let\u0026rsquo;s look under the hood at our HEAD variable. HEAD is just git\u0026rsquo;s pointer to \u0026ldquo;where you are now,\u0026rdquo; usually referring to the current branch. More on this later. We can see that right now, it points to our current branch - master\nNow, if we look at our master reference, we can see that it points to the latest commit.\n$\u0026gt; cat .git/HEAD ref: refs/heads/git2 $\u0026gt; cat .git/refs/heads/master d49019211c6a7a4afddd64b1bc5192a042b80ede d490192... is the hash of the commit we saw in the last step. You can confirm this by running git log\n$\u0026gt; git log --oneline | head -n 1 43388f Initial commit Git stores references in the .git/refs/heads/ directory, and the HEAD pointer in .git/HEAD\nWe can verify this by creating a new branch.\n$\u0026gt; git branch new_branch The git branch command will create a new branch without switching to it.\nNow, if we look in .git/refs, we\u0026rsquo;ll see two branches. The master branch, which is created by default, and new_branch.\n$\u0026gt; tree .git/refs .git/refs ├── heads │ ├── master │ └── new_branch └── tags Note : To create a branch and switch to it you could use the checkout command 1  git checkout -b \u0026lt;new_branch_name\u0026gt;   Merge Conflict A Merge conflict* usually happens when you attempt to merge two branches, but the files have diverged in different ways. When this happens git stops until the conflict are resolved.\nLets create a conflict Initially am in master.\nLets check all the files that are available in the current branch.\n1  git ls-files # does this list untracked files ?    Create a file hello.txt  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  touch hello.txt echo \u0026#34;Hello Edwin\u0026#34; \u0026gt; hello.txt # cat to see the content cat hello.txt git ls-files # this t    Create a new branch form the master and switch to it. The simplest way to achieve this is  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  git checkout -b git2 # Future me decides. the greeting should be in swahili and overwrites echo \u0026#34;Habari Yako Bwana Edwin\u0026#34; \u0026gt; hello.txt # cat to see the content now # Habari Yako Bwana Edwin    Add the new change to the staging area and commit the change.  1 2 3  git add hello.txt git commit -m \u0026#34;Changed the greating to Swahili\u0026#34;    Let checkout to master and try to merged the git2 to master.  1  git merge git2   Follow along Exercise- References Overview In this exercise, we\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at our references (refs) and create some lightweight and annotated tags. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll make a dangling commit from a \u0026ldquo;detached HEAD\u0026rdquo; state and learn why this isn\u0026rsquo;t a great idea.\nPrerequisite You should have the advanced-git-exercises repository cloned locally. Checkout the git3 branch to begin:\n$\u0026gt; git checkout git3 Switched to branch 'exercise3' Exercise  Check the value of your HEAD variable (hint: look in .git) and confirm you\u0026rsquo;re pointed at the git3 branch. Use show-ref to look at your other heads. Create a lightweight tag and confirm that it\u0026rsquo;s pointing at the right commit. Create an annotated tag, and use git show to see more information about it. Get into a \u0026ldquo;detached HEAD\u0026rdquo; state by checking out a specific commit, then confirm that your HEAD is pointing at this commit rather than at a branch. Make a new commit, then switch branches to confirm that you\u0026rsquo;re leaving a commit behind.  Solutions Step 1 - Where\u0026rsquo;s your HEAD? Assuming you checked out the git3 branch in Step 0, your HEAD should be pointing to git3. You can corroborate this with git branch:\n$\u0026gt; cat .git/HEAD ref: refs/heads/exercise3 $\u0026gt; git branch git1 git2 * git3 master Step 2 - Where are your refs? Use git show-ref to see which commits your HEADs are pointing at. You should see one for every branch you have, as well as every remote branch we\u0026rsquo;ve interacted with. Yours may look slightly different.\n$\u0026gt; git show-ref --heads 3811dbf83556ffc5d50f9ac3a387b8f29c3d06c1 refs/heads/git1 56b0fe1d853f9e09a131a851c93e2c92ba8a6bf2 refs/heads/git2 d49019211c6a7a4afddd64b1bc5192a042b80ede refs/heads/git3 d9a034a13998d11ed74e678bbe37e29259242beb refs/heads/master 3811dbf83556ffc5d50f9ac3a387b8f29c3d06c1 refs/remotes/origin/HEAD dd160f7cbcaef119f7fb3063df6e9d0607b5e89c refs/remotes/origin/git2 3811dbf83556ffc5d50f9ac3a387b8f29c3d06c1 refs/remotes/origin/master f94045e34e98329df15b098615268f91c2107eea refs/stash You can see for yourself that our `master` branch is pointing to our \u0026quot;Initial commit\u0026quot; $\u0026gt; git cat-file -p d49019211c6a7a4afddd64b1bc5192a042b80ede tree f21db101b5860d09c98d808ae21aaa96fa512414 parent dd160f7cbcaef119f7fb3063df6e9d0607b5e89c author eduuh \u0026lt;edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com\u0026gt; 1582476695 +0300 committer eduuh \u0026lt;edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com\u0026gt; 1582476695 +0300 Initial commit Whereas our git3 branch is pointing to our newer commit from git2:\n$\u0026gt; git cat-file -p d49019211c6a7a4afddd64b1bc5192a042b80ede tree f21db101b5860d09c98d808ae21aaa96fa512414 parent dd160f7cbcaef119f7fb3063df6e9d0607b5e89c author eduuh \u0026lt;edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com\u0026gt; 1582476695 +0300 committer eduuh \u0026lt;edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com\u0026gt; 1582476695 +0300 Initial commit Step 3 - Lightweight Tags: Lightweight tags are simply named pointers to a commit.

Below that, we see the commit that was tagged, and then the diff between the tagged commit and its parent.\nStep 5 - Detached HEAD Now we\u0026rsquo;re going to venture into a \u0026ldquo;detached HEAD\u0026rdquo; state. Use git checkout to checkout the latest commit directly. You\u0026rsquo;ll get a scary-looking warning about your HEAD being detached. You can confirm this by looking at .git/HEAD and seeing that it\u0026rsquo;s now pointing to a commit hash, instead of refs/heads/exercise3\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24  $\u0026gt; git log --oneline d490192 (HEAD -\u0026gt; git3, tag: git2tagannotatedtag, tag: git2tag) Initial commit dd160f7 (origin/git2) continue reading the shell scripting book . finished today one hour 96aa314 finished working on Section one part two 3811dbf (origin/master, origin/HEAD, git1) Section one: part one covered 9be8c2f Initial commite348ebc Testing the emergency git-casting system 43388fe Initial commit $\u0026gt; git checkout d49019 Note: checking out \u0026#39;d49019\u0026#39;. You are in \u0026#39;detached HEAD\u0026#39; state. You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout. If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example: git checkout -b \u0026lt;new-branch-name\u0026gt; HEAD is now at e348ebc... Testing the emergency git-casting system $\u0026gt; cat .git/HEAD e348ebc1187cb3b4066b1e9432a614b464bf9d07   Step 6 - Create a Dangling Commit Even though our HEAD is now pointing at a specific commit - instead of a branch or tag - we can still make commits. Go ahead and make a new commit, then confirm that our HEAD is now pointing at this new commit:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  $\u0026gt; echo \u0026#34;This is a test file\u0026#34; \u0026gt; dangle.txt $\u0026gt; git add dangle.txt $\u0026gt; git commit -m \u0026#34;This is a dangling commit\u0026#34; [detached HEAD 510b8d7] this is a dangling commit Date: Fri Feb 28 11:39:28 2020 +0300 1 files changed, 1 insertion(+) create mode 100644 dangle.txt $\u0026gt; git log --oneline 510b8d7 (HEAD) this is a dangling commit d490192 (tag: git2tagannotatedtag, tag: git2tag, git3) Initial commit dd160f7 (origin/git2) continue reading the shell scripting book . finished today one hour 96aa314 finished working on Section one part two 3811dbf (origin/master, origin/HEAD, git1) Section one: part one covered 9be8c2f Initial commit $\u0026gt; cat .git/HEAD 510b8d7e663539778d20a93a262e337b8115b080   But wait. Because our new commit - 510b8d7 in this case - was made in a detached HEAD state, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any references pointing to it. It\u0026rsquo;s not part of a branch, and has no tags. This is called a Dangling Commit. You\u0026rsquo;ll see this warning if you try to switch branches:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  $\u0026gt; git checkout exercise3 D exercises/2.exercisetwo.md Warning: you are leaving 1 commit behind, not connected to any of your branches: 510b8d7 this is a dangling commit If you want to keep it by creating a new branch, this may be a good time to do so with: git branch \u0026lt;new-branch-name\u0026gt; 510b8d7 Switched to branch \u0026#39;git2\u0026#39; Your branch is ahead of \u0026#39;origin/git2\u0026#39; by 3 commits. (use \u0026#34;git push\u0026#34; to publish your local commits)   Here, git is warning you that you\u0026rsquo;re leaving this commit dangling. If you wish, you may create a new branch that points to this commit. Git does a periodic garbage collection and will eventually delete any commits that don\u0026rsquo;t have a reference pointing to them.\nGit Rerere Stands for (Reuse and Recorded Resolution)\nGit save how you resolve a conflict and when this conflict arise in the future git will use the same\nresolution to solve the conflict.\nUseful for:\n Long lived feature branch and when you are perfoming a refactor. When rebasing a repository.  Turn it on. It usually disabled by default.\n1 2  # use --global flag to enable for all projects. git config rerere.enabled true   Note: it would be nice you you activate this feature per project basis.\nSome Common Commands   checkout a branch and create some changes.

Checkout the git4 branch:\n$\u0026gt; git checkout git4 Switched to a new branch 'git4' Exercise  Practice creating a well-crafted commit - look at the format given on the slides for help. Use git log to find commits created since yesterday. Rename a file and use the --name-status and --follow options to git log to track down when the file was renamed, and what it used to be called. Use --grep to search within commit messages, and --diff-filter to find renamed and modified files from git log. Use git show to get more information about a specific git hash. Try the --merged and --no-merged options to git branch to see which branches have been merged into master (or not).  Solutions Step 1 - Make a Good Commit We\u0026rsquo;ve all made commits with short, \u0026ldquo;silly\u0026rdquo;, or otherwise unhelpful messages. Let\u0026rsquo;s practice making a solid commit message for use in this example.\n# Change your `hello.txt` to say [greeting] [noun]! however you want to change it. $\u0026gt; cat hello.txt [greeting] [noun]! # Rename hello.txt to hello.template $\u0026gt; git mv hello.txt hello.template $\u0026gt; # if you do a git status you will realize that hello.template is renamed. $\u0026gt; git add hello.template $\u0026gt; git commit # This will open your text editor # Type the following... Replacing greeting with tokens for i18n Currently, hello.txt contains both Spanish and English. Let's replace Hola with a [greeting] token, and Mundo with a [noun] token. That way, we can localize hello.txt for any language! # Save and exit your editor [exercise5 4b2b90e] Replacing greeting with tokens for i18n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-) Step 2 - Git Log Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at our new commit using git log. First we\u0026rsquo;ll see how to see all commits in the log since yesterday:\n$\u0026gt; git log --since=\u0026quot;yesterday\u0026quot; commit 886265f1cd786eec7bf48548f290d162d5307051 (HEAD -\u0026gt; git4) Author: eduuh \u0026lt;edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com\u0026gt; Date: Fri Feb 28 12:32:28 2020 +0300 Replaced greeting with varibles for i18n Currently, hello.txt contains both spanish and English. Let's replace with a [greeting] token and Mundo with a [noun] token. that way, we can localize hello.txt for any language! commit e7410d10d86edd1bca30f4fa4dbd2e80385518fd (master) Merge: d9a034a cb0ba30 Author: eduuh \u0026lt;edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com\u0026gt; Date: Fri Feb 28 12:00:46 2020 +0300 Merge branch 'git3' Things can get tricky when trying to track down changes to files when they\u0026rsquo;ve been renamed. Here we see how to use git log to find the commit where hello.txt was renamed to hello.template. The --follow command will continue following the file backward in history, showing its filename for every commit:\n$\u0026gt; git log --name-status --follow --oneline hello.template 886265f (HEAD -\u0026gt; git4) Replaced greeting with varibles for i18n A hello.template Ever spent too much time trying to track down a commit in Github? Use git log --grep to quickly find a commit. We can chain this with other flags. Let\u0026rsquo;s find all the internationalization commits that the author eduuh has added in the last two weeks:\n$\u0026gt; git log --grep=i18n --author=eduuh --since=2.weeks commit 886265f1cd786eec7bf48548f290d162d5307051 (HEAD -\u0026gt; git4) Author: eduuh \u0026lt;edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com\u0026gt; Date: Fri Feb 28 12:32:28 2020 +0300 Replaced greeting with varibles for i18n Currently, hello.txt contains both spanish and English. Let's replace with a [greeting] token and Mundo with a [noun] token. that way, we can localize hello.txt for any language! We can use --diff-filter to find commits where files have been renamed:\n$\u0026gt; git log --diff-filter=R --find-renames 4b2b90e Replacing greeting with tokens for i18n Or to find commits where files have been modified:\n$\u0026gt; git log --diff-filter=M --oneline fec9e7b Changing Hello to Hola afa34a6 Changing World to Mundo e348ebc Testing the emergency git-casting system Step 3 - Git Show Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve mastered git log, how do we actually see what happened in a commit? Let\u0026rsquo;s use git show to find out.\n$\u0026gt; git log --grep=i18n --oneline 886265f1cd7 Replacing greeting with tokens for i18n # Let's see the full commit and diff for 4b2b90e $\u0026gt; git show 886265f1cd7 commit 886265f1cd786eec7bf48548f290d162d5307051 (HEAD -\u0026gt; git4) Author: eduuh \u0026lt;edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com\u0026gt; Date: Fri Feb 28 12:32:28 2020 +0300 Replaced greeting with varibles for i18n Currently, hello.txt contains both spanish and English.
